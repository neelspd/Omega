Creep is high temperature progressive deformation at constant stress. "High temperature" is a relative term dependent upon the materials involved. Creep rates are used in evaluating materials for boilers, gas turbines, jet engines, ovens, or any application that involves high temperatures under load. Understanding high temperature behavior of metals is useful in designing failure resistant systems.

A creep test involves a tensile specimen under a constant load maintained at a constant temperature. Measurements of strain are then recorded over a period of time.

Creep occurs in three stages: Primary, or Stage I; Secondary, or Stage II: and Tertiary, or Stage III. Stage I, or Primary creep occurs at the beginning of the tests, and creep is mostly transiently, not at a steady rate. Resistance to creep increases until Stage II is reached. In Stage II, or Secondary creep, The rate of creep becomes roughly steady. This stage is often referred to as steady state creep. In Stage III, or tertiary creep, the creep rate begins to accelerate as the cross sectional area of the specimen decreases due to necking or internal voiding decreases the effective area of the specimen. If stage III is allowed to proceed, fracture will occur. (source: http://www.wmtr.com/en.whatisacreeptest.html)

This system which will aid the engineers in this evaluation by acquiring the data from the test setup every second and will plot the graph based on the acquired data and also save the data in CSV format for further processing and analysis.

# Getting Started
Connect Reaspberry Pi and Other Circuitory in Proper Manner
The Components needed will be,

-> DHT 11 or any DHT Family Hygrometer and Temperature Sensor

-> Generic Soil Hygrometer

-> Raspberry Pi (Any Version)

-> Generic Relay Motor Driver Circuit

-> Water pump

-> Fan (Small Size)

Note: I have Used Low Voltage Components on AC Supply via AC to DC converter.
